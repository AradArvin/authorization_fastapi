# Authorization project using FastAPI

**This is a fastapi microservice used for authorization. the idea was to use two microservices.**

**for user authentication, I used another microservice.**

## Technologies used in this microservice:
- FastAPI
- Redis(caching)
- gRPC
- JWT access and refresh token
- JWT algorithm: ES256 with protected private key and public key
